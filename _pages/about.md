I am a 1st year PhD student with the Centre for Doctoral Training in Designing Responsible Natural Language Processing at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Dr Edoardo Ponti. I graduated from Master's in Computer Science from Koç University, where I was also an AI Fellow at KUIS AI Center.

I am interested in developing efficient multimodal models that can systematically generalize across all sorts of settings. My MSc thesis is about leveraging language models' dynamics to improve their compositional generalization capabilities. I worked on multimodal compositional generalization, medical vision-language models, and medical language modeling as well.
