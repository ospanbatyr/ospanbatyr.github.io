Hi. My name is Osman Batur İnce, and I am an AI Fellow at [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/){:target="_blank"} and graduate student at Koç University. I have obtained my BSc degree from Bilkent University, Computer Science and hopefully my MSc from Koç University, Computer Science and Engineering. I plan on doing my PhD abroad, thus please feel free to contact me.

My research at KUIS AI Lab is focused on mainly natural language processing with a bit of computer vision sprinkled on it. I am advised by [Assoc. Prof. Aykut Erdem](https://aykuterdem.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. I am also working closely with [Assoc. Prof. Erkut Erdem](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~erkut/){:target="_blank"} from Hacettepe University.
